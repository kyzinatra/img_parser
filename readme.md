# prnt.com Parser

This parser was created by me only for educational purposes
and does not presuppose use for any other (purposes).

To start the program:

> git clone (url)
> cd img_parser
> npm install
> npm run start

Then you can open public/result.json
You can see all settings in the ./public/settings.json file
Other scripts:

> npm run tobase64

To encode all images in result to base64 (./public/result/result.json)

> npm run settings

The script asks for all settings in turn and writes them to a file (./public/settings.json)

> num run html

Converts the entire result to an html gallery (./public/result/result.html)
